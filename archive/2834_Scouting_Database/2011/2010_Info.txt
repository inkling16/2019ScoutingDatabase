A presentation published at a similar time as this database is also included in this folder. 

Here was the information posted by Ed Law along with the database when the initial version was released: 
- The 2010 Scouting Database from Team 2834 is out. I added links for Week One only. I have to do it manually and it is very time consuming. I wrote a program last summer to add links automatically but it is not working. With the changes in scoring this year, I don’t know if they are changing the format. I am going to wait until past Week One before I do the rest. We are going to a Week One competition also so I will not have time to re-publish it on Friday if it does not work. I apologize in advance.

- A few words about OPR and CCWM this year. There were some discussions about whether OPR and CCWM have any meaning this year. So far I stayed out of that discussion partly because I was busy working with my team to build our robot. Also I do not want to get into a debate. If you do not think OPR and CCWM is useful this year, don’t read on. I am not trying to convince you.
- 
- So here is my thought on OPR and CCWM. The number of goals scored this year is meaningless because teams who have a big lead will try to score for their opponents. The winning margin is therefore meaningless also. Unlike last year where the offensive score was based on how many moon rocks and supercells were scored, this year the reported score is not based on goals. The reported score is actually the seeding score. Since teams will try to maximize their seeding score, they will try their best.
- 
- The interpretation of OPR this year has to be changed slightly. It is not a measure of how strong their offensive power or how many balls the team can score. It is a measure of how successful the team is to get a high seeding score for their alliance. This is why I think OPR is still meaningful but we have to interpret it differently.
- 
- On the other hand, I think CCWM has no meaning this year because of the way the coopertition points are given out. However, my program will still calculate and report CCWM. I do not want to change the program just for this year.
