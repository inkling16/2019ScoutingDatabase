Here was the original information posted by Karthik along with this database: 
- Here’s our 4th annual Championship Event database. We are well aware that some data is missing. Also, we take no responsibility for the accuracy of the data. I think it’s close to 99% accurate. Unfortunately, there will be no updates to the public edition of the database.

- Thanks should go to Team 1114’s Team Strategy for the creation of this database, especially Geoff Allan and Roberto.
- 
- Enjoy.
