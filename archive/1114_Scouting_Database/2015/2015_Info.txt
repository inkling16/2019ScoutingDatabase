Here was the original information posted by Geoff1114 along with this database: 
- Attached is the 2015 Team 1114 Championship Database. This year’s database includes full results for every team who competed in the 2015 season. We’ve based this version on the current divisions posted at usfirst.org.
- 
- The database includes:
- -An interface to allow you pull an individual team’s details
- -Full listing of awards, qualification average & finish
- -Team scoring averages
- -Total OPR as well as Auto, Container+Tote, Coopertition and Litter OPR. These calculations use linear algebra to determine what a team’s average input to their alliance was at each regional. (Only using qualifying match results)
- -A master sheet for a sortable comparison of all FIRST teams
- -Master sheets for each division and full divisional assignments
- -A quick Divisional Stats Summary
- 
- The data we have was all mined from the FIRST website. There may be some errors, but we’re confident the data is 97.1114% accurate.
- 
- Prior to 2008 we never released any of our regression analysis (OPR) that we had been doing since 2004. Since people have become more knowledgeable on the subject we decided to make the change. Please do not take a poor score as a slight or an insult. We simply used the actual scores from matches to perform a calculation. We feel that this tool is the best available metric if you are unable to watch the actual matches. Since none of us can attend every regional, it should be a valuable tool. If you want more details on this, come check out Karthik’s seminar in St. Louis.
