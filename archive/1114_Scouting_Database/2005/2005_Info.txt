The link on CD has gone dead, so the version here is an 1114 internal version of the database which has been modified by Karthik for public release. 

Here was the original information posted by Karthik along with this database: 
- In response to this thread (https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/dr-joe-disclaimer-favor-request/62391) started by Dr. Joe, I decided to compile all the information that was being looked for. It was no small effort, as accurate results have been hard to come by this year. But after some long hours and a few Red Bulls, here it is.

- There is some missing data, if anyone can help fill in these gaps, please send me a PM or an email. The list of what is missing can be found on the “notes” tab of the spreadsheet. The most important missing data is from the elimination rounds of the St. Louis and Long Island regionals.

- Also, I am missing a whole bunch of the team nicknames. If anyone is up to the task of finding them, send me a list, and I’ll make an update.

- The division info is obviously missing, I’ll post an update on Monday as soon as it comes out.

- Thanks to everyone who helped me out with this project.

- If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or corrections, please let me know via PM or this thread.

- Enjoy,
