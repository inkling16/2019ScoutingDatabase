The link on CD has gone dead, so the version here is an 1114 internal version of the database which has been modified by Karthik for public release. 

Here was the original information posted by Karthik along with this database: 
- A few people have been asking about it, so here it is. The Annual Niagara FIRST Championship Scouting Database. If there are any comments or concerns please let me know. If there are any major errors Iâ€™ll try and post and update. Feel free to cannibalize this in any way you want.
