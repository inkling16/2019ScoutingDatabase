Here was the original information posted by Karthik along with this database: 
- Greetings all,
- 
- Attached is the 2009 Team 1114 Championship Database. This year’s database includes full results for every team who competed in the 2009 season as well. Version 1.0 does not have the divisional assignments. We will issue an updated version on the evening of the day the divisions are announced. This will be the final update of the database.
- 
- The database includes:
- 
- An interface allow you pull an individual team’s record
- Full listing of awards, record & finish
- Team scoring averages
- “Calculated Contribution” which is the same calculation being refered to as OPR on these forums. This calculation usings linear alegbra to determine what a team’s average input to their alliance was at each regional. (Only using qualifying match results) We found an average correlation between R = 0.7 and 0.85 to observed emperical scouting data
- A master sheet for a sortable comparison of all FIRST teams
- Version 2.0 will include
- 
- Master sheets for each division and full divisional assigments
- The data we have was all mined from the FIRST website. There may be some errors, but I’m confident the data is 97.1114% accurate. If you notice any errors please respond to this thread, and we will correct them for Version 2.0.
- 
- Prior to 2008 we never released any of our regression analysis (Calculated Contribution) that we had been doing since 2004. Since people have become more knowledgeable on the subject we decided to make the change. Please do not take a poor score as a slight or an insult. We simply used the actual scores from matches to perform a calculation. We feel that this tool is the best available metric if you are unable to watch the actual matches. Since none of us can attend every regional, it should be a valuable tool. That being said, because of the defensive nature of Lunacy, the regression analysis is not as valuable as it was in more offensive games such as Overdrive.
- 
- Thanks to Geoff Allan and Roberto Rotolo of Team 1114 for creating this year’s database.

- If you have any questions, please ask.

- Edit: Version 2.0 is now up, with divisions.
